# Yantrix - Opinionated FSM Framework

Yantrix is a TypeScript framework that provides a set of tools to create a code-generated state management, using
event-driven finite state machines and anemic data model. It represents an application state as a flock of independent
FSMs which communicate through a common event bus and operate on a single state object, which is separated from actual
business logic, making it a great counterpart to any functional state manager like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), while
keeping the logic part of it robust and declarative

## Installation

To install Yantrix, you can use NPM or Yarn:

```
npm install yantrix
```

or

```
yarn add yantrix
```

## Core Concepts

Yantrix suggests the following application model:
- Responsibility layers are built in accordance with slightly adapted [MVC approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
- an [Event-Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) is used to communicate between layers of "Contoller" part, with a globally available dictionary of `Events`, specific for the Application
- _"Controller"_ is comprised of `Slices`, which are sets of interconnected `FSM`s (finite state machines), which communicate with `Events` and produce `Effects` to update the _"Model"_
- _"View"_ part (including UI and external I/O) is updated asynchronously with a **Render Loop**
- I/O streams are non-duplex and are separated into `Sources`, which generate `Events` for "Controller", and `Destinations`, which are updated when the _"Model"_ has changed
- _"Model"_ component is an anemic data structure (`Data Model`), being a single global store for the whole application, though it can and should be built with composition of `Slices`. It can be propagated to external `Storages` in a asynchronous **Sync Loop**
- the **Main Loop** is taking `Events` from UI and I/O and repeatedly updates the `Data Model` and `Slices` internal states based on their internal rules

The basic building block of state logic is a `FSM` (more specifically - a [Mealy Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine)), which exposes two predefined sets: `Actions` and `States`, with `Transition Matrix` describing the relations between those. Every `Action` type can have a derived `Payload` type, while every `State` has a dependent `Context`, and the latter two represent the current internal state of the machine.
